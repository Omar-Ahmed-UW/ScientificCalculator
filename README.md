# ScientificCalculator
C++ scientific calculator can handle single letter lower or upper case variables or numbers as input.

Operations that can be performed: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, raising to the power.

Run driver.cpp to start application. After entering equations enter the "." character to end input stream.

Input is written as "1+2" not "1 + 2" | no whitespace. To assign a value to a variable use ":=" operator and to raise to the power use the format "a^b". Program processes input of mathematical statements in bulk saving variables if set to a value then prints out both input and output in sequence of entry.
